# CodingNest Bootcamp — Day 3 Assignment

## Job Search Dashboard

Welcome to your **Day 3 CodingNest Bootcamp assignment**.

In this assignment, you will build a **Job Search Dashboard** — similar to job discovery platforms like LinkedIn.

The goal is to create a dynamic web application where users can search for jobs, filter results, and bookmark interesting opportunities.

---

# UI Design

Follow the UI design provided here:

**Design Link**

[https://codingnest-bootcamp-day-3.figma.site/](https://codingnest-bootcamp-day-3.figma.site/)

Your implementation should closely match the layout, spacing, and components shown in the design.

---

# Objective

Build an application where users can:

1. Search for jobs by title
2. Filter jobs based on location or job type
3. View job listings dynamically
4. Bookmark/save jobs for later

---

# Features to Implement

## 1. Job Search Bar

Create a search input where users can enter job titles such as:

* Frontend Developer
* Backend Engineer
* Product Manager

When the user types or submits:

* Fetch jobs from the API
* Filter results based on the search query
* Update the UI dynamically

---

## 2. Filters (Location / Job Type)

Provide filters such as:

* Location (e.g., Remote, Delhi, Bangalore)
* Job Type (Full-time, Part-time, Internship)

These filters should:

* Work on API data
* Dynamically update job listings

---

## 3. Job Listings (Dynamic Cards)

Display jobs in a **card-based layout**.

Each job card should include:

* Job Title
* Company Name
* Location
* Job Type
* Salary (if available)
* Apply Link

The job list should:

* Render dynamically from API data
* Update when search or filters change

---

## 4. Bookmark Feature

Allow users to **save/bookmark jobs**.

Functionality:

* Add/remove bookmark
* Store bookmarked jobs in **localStorage**
* Persist data after page refresh

Optional UI ideas:

* Bookmark icon (⭐ / ❤️)
* Separate “Saved Jobs” section

---

## 5. API Integration

Use the following jobs API:

```
https://fakejobs-api.vercel.app/jobs
```

Your application must:

* Fetch data using **Fetch API**
* Use **async/await**
* Parse and render response data
* Handle errors properly

---

## 6. Loading & Empty States

Handle UI states properly:

* Show loader while fetching jobs
* Show “No jobs found” when no results match
* Handle API errors gracefully

---

# Technologies to Use

Use the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
* Fetch API
* localStorage

❌ Frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, or libraries like jQuery are not allowed.

---

# Expected Learning Outcomes

By completing this assignment, you will learn how to:

* Work with **search inputs and filtering logic**
* Fetch and render **API data dynamically**
* Build reusable **card-based UI components**
* Use **localStorage for saving user data**
* Handle **real-world states (loading, empty, error)**
* Build a **job discovery dashboard**

---
