# CodingNest Bootcamp — Day 1 Assignment

## Personal Finance Dashboard

Welcome to your **first CodingNest Bootcamp assignment**.

In this assignment, you will build a **Personal Finance Dashboard** similar to expense tracking applications like Splitwise.

The goal is to build a simple web application where users can:

* Track daily expenses
* Categorize transactions
* View all transactions in a table
* Visualize spending using charts

This assignment focuses on **core frontend development skills** including DOM manipulation, browser storage, and data visualization.

---

# UI Design

Follow the UI design provided here:

**Design Link**

[https://codingnest-bootcamp-day-1.figma.site](https://codingnest-bootcamp-day-1.figma.site)

Your implementation should match the layout and components shown in the design.

---

# Objective

Build a dashboard where users can:

1. Add expenses
2. View all transactions
3. Categorize spending
4. Visualize spending analytics

All data must persist using **browser localStorage**.

---

# Features to Implement

## 1. Expense Input Form

Create a form where users can enter expense details.

The form should allow users to add:

* Expense title / description
* Amount
* Category
* Date (if present in the design)

When the form is submitted:

* The expense should be added to the dashboard
* The UI should update dynamically

---

## 2. Transaction Table

Display all recorded expenses in a **table format**.

Each transaction should include:

* Expense name
* Category
* Amount
* Date (if present)

Whenever a new expense is added, the table should **update automatically**.

---

## 3. Expense Categories

Expenses should be grouped into categories such as:

* Food
* Travel
* Bills
* Shopping
* Others

These categories will be used for **analytics visualization**.

---

## 4. Spending Analytics Chart

Integrate **Chart.js** to display spending analytics.

The chart should visualize **how money is distributed across categories**.

Possible chart types include:

* Pie chart
* Doughnut chart
* Bar chart

The chart should **update automatically when expenses change**.

---

## 5. Data Persistence

All data must be stored using **localStorage**.

Your application should:

* Save expenses to localStorage
* Load saved expenses when the page reloads

This ensures users do not lose their data.

---

# Technologies to Use

Use the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
* Chart.js
* localStorage

Frameworks such as **React, Vue, Angular, or libraries like jQuery are not allowed** for this assignment.

---

# Expected Learning Outcomes

By completing this assignment, you will learn how to:

* Work with **HTML forms**
* Use **JavaScript DOM manipulation**
* Dynamically update UI components
* Store data using **localStorage**
* Visualize data using **Chart.js**
* Build a simple **dashboard interface**

---
